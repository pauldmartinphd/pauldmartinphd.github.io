I build trustworthy computing systems—from bare-metal firmware to cloud-scale analytics.  

As **Chief Scientist at Harbor Experts** and a **Lecturer in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University**, I combine hands-on engineering with expert testimony in high-stakes litigation. I’ve performed **technical analyses and source code reviews in over 100 matters**, testified in federal and state courts, and am known for designing **custom experiments and reconstructing technical evidence even in cases where source code is lost or unavailable**.  

An inventor on **six U.S. patents** and a published researcher, I specialize in software and operating system security, embedded systems, reverse engineering, and network protocol analysis. My work spans everything from modifying hardware and firmware to designing automated analysis engines and building secure cloud-based platforms.
